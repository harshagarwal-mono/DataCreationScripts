# Output Files Directory

This directory stores the output files generated by various data generation scripts.

## Current Outputs

### License Management
- `license-events.csv` - CSV report of events generated in the sync_download table
  - Contains all newly added events with their details
  - Generated in real-time as events are inserted
  - For detailed information about the fields and format, see [License Management Documentation](../LicenseManagement/README.md#output)

## File Formats
- CSV files for detailed event reports
- JSON files for structured data outputs (when applicable)

## Usage
Output files are automatically generated in this directory when running the data generation scripts. Each module will create its own output files with appropriate naming conventions and will document their specific output formats in their respective documentation.
